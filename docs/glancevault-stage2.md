# dayGLANCE → GLANCEvault DB-tier cutover — STAGE 2 of 2

Stage 1 proved **representability** (shred/reassemble is lossless on one device).
Stage 2 proves **merge correctness** across two devices, then wires the live
transport. Part A is the gate; Part B is the wiring.

Artifacts:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/sync/dbAdapter.js` | Per-row apply/merge added on top of stage-1 shred/reassemble |
| `src/sync/dbVaultSim.js` | In-memory two-device GLANCEvault simulator (test support) |
| `src/sync/dbMerge.test.js` | A1 bundle-merge + A2 cross-list tests |

## Part A — multi-device merge correctness (the gate)

### The harness

`dbVaultSim.js` runs two devices against one in-memory vault. It faithfully
mirrors `createDbSyncEngine`'s push/pull contract (`dbEngine.js`): push encrypts
each dirty entity (here: JSON clone) and upserts by `entityId`; pull lists rows
since the cursor and applies each with entity-grain LWW, insert-only
always-apply, and delete-by-absence — driving the **same** adapter callbacks the
real engine calls (`getLocalEntity` / `applyRemoteEntity` / `applyRemoteDelete` /
`isInsertOnly` / `getEntityLastModified`). Two documented, behavior-preserving
divergences: the pull cursor advances only on pull (a strictly more conservative
cursor — re-applying a seen row is idempotent), and `reconcileCrossList` runs at
end-of-pull (the live engine hooks this to the apply-notify).

### The core hazard Part A exists to surface

GLANCEvault stores **one row per `entityId`**, upserted last-write-wins, and the
engine **pushes before it pulls**. So when two devices edit the *same bundle row*
between syncs, the second push **clobbers** the first at the vault before the
first device's value is ever read. A merge in the apply step alone cannot recover
it — the value is already gone from the vault.

**Fix (the enabling mechanism):** when a bundle's per-key/union merge leaves a
device's local copy *richer* than the row it just pulled, the device **re-pushes
the merged superset** (`applyRemoteEntity` returns the entityIds to re-dirty).
Because the originating device never *reduces* its local bundle (union grows;
recency keeps newest), the unique contribution is never lost locally and gets
re-published on the next push. This mirrors the file-tier's `remoteChanged →
"remote needs this"` flag and **terminates**: once the vault holds the full
superset, the merge changes nothing and no re-push is emitted. Convergence
requires the originating device to complete one more sync after a concurrent
clobber — the same liveness property the file tier already has.

A1 includes an explicit demonstration that a **naive whole-bundle LWW loses an
edit**, to prove the per-bundle merge + re-push is necessary, not decorative.

### Bundle-merge strategy table

| Bundle | Shape | Strategy | Concurrent **different-entry** edits safe? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `habitLogs` (+`habitLogTimestamps`) | `{date:{habitId:count}}` | per-(date,habitId) recency via paired timestamps (`mergeHabitLogs`) | ✅ yes |
| `routineDefinitions` | `{bucket:[chip]}` | per-chip, claim-aware (`mergeRoutineDefinitions`); chip tombstones converge separately | ✅ yes |
| `routineCompletions` | `{routineId:date}` | union, keep later date per key | ✅ yes |
| `completedTaskUids` | `string[]` | set-union | ✅ yes |
| `deletedTaskIds` | `{id:ISO}` | set-union, keep newer ISO | ✅ yes |
| `deletedRoutineChipIds` | `{id:ISO}` | set-union, keep newer ISO | ✅ yes |
| `deletedFrameIds` | `{id:ISO}` | set-union, keep newer ISO | ✅ yes |
| `removedTodayRoutineIds` | `{id:ISO}` | set-union, keep newer ISO | ✅ yes |
| `deletedHabitIds` | `{id:ISO}` | set-union, keep newer ISO | ✅ yes |
| `deletedGoalIds` | `{id:ISO}` | set-union, keep newer ISO | ✅ yes |
| `deletedProjectIds` | `{id:ISO}` | set-union, keep newer ISO | ✅ yes |
| `habitsEnabled` (+`…UpdatedAt`) | bool+ISO | paired LWW by `UpdatedAt` | n/a — single value (intended LWW) |
| `routinesEnabled` (+`…UpdatedAt`) | bool+ISO | paired LWW by `UpdatedAt` | n/a — single value |
| `goalsProjectsEnabled` (+`…UpdatedAt`) | bool+ISO | paired LWW by `UpdatedAt` | n/a — single value |
| `obsidianConfig` (+`…UpdatedAt`) | obj+ISO | paired LWW by `UpdatedAt` | n/a — single value |
| `unscheduledOrderTimestamp` | ISO | newer-wins | n/a — single value |
| `tombstonePrunedBefore` | ISO | max (newer-wins) | n/a — single value |
| `routinesDate` | date | later-date-wins | n/a — single value |
| `syncUrl`, `taskCalendarUrl` | string | prefer non-empty (don't let an unconfigured device clear a URL) | n/a — single value |
| `minimizedSections`, `use24HourClock`, `weatherZip`, `weatherTempUnit`, `multiUserEnabled` | scalar | **device-local** — kept local, never overwritten or re-pushed (matches `merge.js:900-901`) | n/a — by design |

The "n/a" rows are single-valued settings: there are no independent entries to
lose, so newest-writer-wins is the intended and correct behavior, not a
multi-entry loss window. The device-local prefs are deliberately not converged,
exactly as the file-tier merge keeps them local today.

### Cross-list move (A2)

A task keeps its `id` while moving between the five task kinds, so it maps to a
different `${kind}:${id}` over its life. Moves are **tombstone-on-old +
insert-on-new** (the move marks both entityIds dirty; `getLocalEntity` returns
null for the vacated one → soft-delete; the new one upserts). The delete
suppresses the stale copy on the other device.

For the nasty interleaving — both devices move the same task to **different**
kinds concurrently — `reconcileCrossList` keeps exactly one copy with a
**deterministic** rule, so every device agrees:

> **Winner = newest `lastModified`. Tie → `CROSS_LIST_PRIORITY`
> (`recycleBin` > `recurringTasks` > `tasks` > `unscheduledTasks` >
> `todayRoutines`).**

recycleBin sorts first so an explicit delete wins a same-instant tie (mirrors
`merge.js:540-543`, where a recycle entry wins on a non-older timestamp). Each
removed copy is soft-deleted on the next push, so the **vault** converges too,
not just local state. Tests cover the simple move, the concurrent
different-kind move (newest wins), and the priority tie-break.

### Gate result

- **A1 (bundle merge): PASS** — concurrent different-entry edits to every bundle
  are preserved; naive-LWW loss demonstrated and avoided.
- **A2 (cross-list move): PASS** — moved tasks end under exactly one kind;
  concurrent different-kind moves resolve to a deterministic winner.
- **A3 (regression): PASS** — full suite **286/286** (275 existing + stage-1
  losslessness 9 + 11 new).
- **Unavoidable loss windows: NONE.** With the re-push mechanism, every
  multi-entry bundle converges; the only LWW is single-valued settings, which is
  intended. **Gate is GREEN — proceed to Part B.**

## Part B — live wiring

Mirrors the lastGLANCE reference. Additive and reversible: the DB engine runs
**alongside** the file-tier WebDAV engine, sharing only the local data and sync
passphrase, and is **fully inert when the vault is disabled** (`createDbEngine`
returns null, the cadence effect early-returns, `schedulePush` is a no-op). The
file-tier payload is retained untouched — nothing is deleted, and the default
transport is unchanged.

| Piece | File | One-line summary |
|---|---|---|
| **B1** vault config + gate | `vaultConfig.js`, `deviceId.js`, `dbEngine.js` | `dayglance-vault-config` key + `isVaultEnabled`; stable `dayglance-device-id`; `createDbEngine` constructs the real `createDbSyncEngine` alongside WebDAV, returns null when off, HWM-0 seeds the full snapshot. |
| **B2** dirty tracking + safe apply | `dbEngine.js` | Dirty set computed by diffing the current shred against a persisted snapshot (dayGLANCE's equivalent of per-write `markDirty`, since it has no data-layer); remote applies mutate a per-cycle mirror committed once via `applyPayload`, which sets the suppress flags so a pulled row never bounces back as a WebDAV upload or a re-push. |
| **B3** push-on-write | `dirtyTracker.js`, `useSaveOnChange.js` | Debounced **3 s, vault-only** push after each local write; never fans out to WebDAV (the file tier keeps its cadence model, spec 6.5); off-safe. |
| **B4** transport UI | `CloudSyncSettingsForm.jsx` | Independent GLANCEvault toggle (URL/token/account), saved to its own key, **reload on change**; orthogonal to the WebDAV provider. |
| **B5** WebDAV retained | — | File-tier engine, payload, and merge are completely unchanged; the DB engine never touches the WebDAV file. |

### Cycle ordering note

dayGLANCE composes its cycle **pull-then-push** (the engine's built-in
`dbSyncCycle` is push-then-pull). The engine advances its high-water mark on
push (`dbEngine.js:225`), so a device that pushed before pulling would skip rows
written below its new cursor and never see them — observed directly as a failing
end-to-end test. Pulling first means the HWM only ever advances past rows the
device has actually seen, and bundle merges push the merged superset in the same
cycle. Built from the engine's exposed `pullRemoteChanges` / `pushDirtyRows` /
`updateDeviceCursor`; the package is not modified.

### Backgrounded-write-reaches-vault check (the lastGLANCE bug)

`dbEngineWiring.test.js` proves the B3 behavior with fake timers: a burst of
writes collapses into **one** debounced `dbSyncCycle` ~3 s after the last write,
it is **vault-only** (the file engine is never called), and it is a no-op once
the engine is detached (vault disabled). So a write on a backgrounded device
reaches the vault without waiting for an app reopen — the bug the lastGLANCE
push-on-write fix addressed. **Confirmed.**

### Part B validation

- End-to-end through the **real** `createDbSyncEngine` + real AES-GCM (in-memory
  vault + native key store, no network/indexedDB): a task syncs A→B; concurrent
  bundle edits converge by set-union; a cross-list move lands under exactly one
  kind. Gate returns null when disabled; deviceId stable; push-on-write debounce
  vault-only + off-safe.
- Full suite **293/293**; production `vite build` passes.

## Verdict

dayGLANCE's data model is **losslessly representable AND correctly mergeable** as
rows under current semantics. No unavoidable loss window. The GLANCEvault DB
transport is wired opt-in alongside WebDAV, non-destructive and reversible.
